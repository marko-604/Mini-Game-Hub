# Mini-Game Hub

## Overview

The Mini-Game Hub is a Windows-based application which was built with C++ and the Windows API. It serves as a launcher for multiple mini-games, including:

- Snake
- Tic Tac Toe
- Number Guessing

The project provides a simple UI with buttons to navigate between the menu and game selection screens.

## Features

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** with buttons for game selection
- **Menu and Game Screens** for seamless transitions
- **Bitmap Background Support** for improved visuals
- **Timer-Based Game Launch** with a countdown mechanism
- **Basic Window Management** using the Windows API

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Windows OS
- A C++ compiler that supports Windows API (e.g., MinGW, MSVC)
- Windows SDK

### Compilation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   https://github.com/marko-604/Mini-Game-Hub.git
   cd Mini-Game-Hub
   ```
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE (Visual Studio recommended).
3. Build the project using your compiler.
4. Run the executable.

## How It Works

1. **Menu Screen:** Displays "Menu" and "Quit" buttons.
2. **Game Selection:** Upon clicking "Menu," the user can choose between three games.
3. **Game Launch:** A message box confirms the selection, followed by a brief countdown before launching the game screen.
4. **Game Play Screen:** A "Play" button appears, allowing interaction with the game (to be implemented).

## Controls

- **Menu Button:** Switches between menu and game selection screen.
- **Quit Button:** Exits the application.
- **Game Buttons:** Selects and starts a game.
- **Play Button:** Initiates the game logic.



## Future Enhancements

- Implementing actual game logic for Snake, Tic Tac Toe, and Number Guessing.
- Adding sound effects and animations.
- Improving UI design with custom graphics.
- Expanding the game library.
